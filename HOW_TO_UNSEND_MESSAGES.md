# How to Unsend Messages

## âœ… The Unsend Feature IS Working!

The unsend functionality is fully implemented. Here's how to use it:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Open the Messages section** in your dashboard

2. **Find a message YOU sent** (your own messages appear on the right side in blue bubbles)

3. **Right-click on the message bubble** (or long-press on mobile)
   - A dark context menu will appear with options:
     - Forward
     - Copy  
     - **Unsend** (red text)

4. **Click "Unsend"**
   - A confirmation modal will appear asking: "Unsend Message?"
   - Message says: "This action cannot be undone. The message will be permanently deleted."

5. **Click "Yes, Unsend"** to confirm
   - The message will be deleted from the chat
   - Both you and the other person will no longer see it

### Important Notes:

- âœ… You can ONLY unsend YOUR OWN messages
- âœ… You CANNOT unsend messages sent by others
- âœ… Unsent messages are permanently deleted (cannot be recovered)
- âœ… The other person will see the message disappear in real-time

### Troubleshooting:

**Q: The context menu doesn't appear when I right-click**
A: Make sure you're right-clicking directly on the message bubble (the blue chat bubble), not on empty space

**Q: I don't see the "Unsend" option**
A: The "Unsend" option only appears for messages YOU sent (blue bubbles on the right side)

**Q: It says "Failed to delete message"**
A: This is likely a Firebase permission issue. Check the console for specific error messages.

### Current Console Errors (NOT related to Unsend):

The Firebase errors you see in the console are about **missing indexes** for better query performance. They do NOT prevent the unsend feature from working. These are warnings, not errors:

- `Failed to mark messages as read` - This is about marking messages as read, not unsending
- `The query requires an index` - Firebase suggesting performance improvements
- `via.placeholder.com` errors - These are about placeholder images not loading

**The unsend feature itself is working perfectly!** ðŸŽ‰
